# Competitor feature matrix & adoption backlog

*Surveyed June 2026. Complements `01-research-and-architecture.md` (field survey);
this doc drives the post-v0.1 feature backlog: what the incumbents do best and
which of those features we adopt, in what order.*

## The field

| Product | Platform | Strengths to steal | Weaknesses we exploit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Frigate 0.16** | Linux/Docker | Two-stage motion→AI (our model already), zone/mask editor, review items split into alerts vs detections, event clips, sub-stream "detect role", MQTT events, face/LPR (now free) | No native Windows/macOS; needs Docker + accelerator setup |
| **Blue Iris 5** | Windows only | 64-camera scale, alarm-server webhooks on events, ONVIF events/PTZ, audio recording, profiles/schedules, &Deadband-style alert tuning | Windows-only, dated UI, per-seat license |
| **UniFi Protect (G6 era)** | UniFi hardware only | Timeline scrubbing UX, smart detect (person/vehicle/pet), camera health/status surface, storage dashboard | Closed ecosystem — only UniFi cameras |
| **Scrypted** | Node, cross-platform | Plugin architecture, HomeKit/Alexa/Google bridging, fast WebRTC | AI depends on plugins/cloud; core is a bridge more than an NVR |
| **ZoneMinder / Shinobi / MotionEye** | Linux | Long-tail camera support, mature retention models | Aged stacks, weak/no native AI, heavy setup |
